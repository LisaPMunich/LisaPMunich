### Hi there 👋 I am Lisa Pape and a -soon to be- certified full-stack web developer. Currently I am doing a 8 month immersive web development course with CareerFounry.

- 💡 I’m currently thinking about doing a new version of my portfolio page in next.js, tailwindCSS and the library rough notation.
- 💟 I love doing the meticulous work, to review, improve on design and details and make code cleaner.
- 👀 I’m always excited to learn new programming languages, expanding my understanding of the whole programming eco system and keep up with the always evolving world of programming.
- 🛠️ I’m looking to collaborate on any amazing projects with a good cause. If it is outside of my current scope, the better. I am willing to study intensely to lern.
