### Hi there 👋 I am Lisa Pape and a certified full-stack web developer with a focus on JavaScript/TypeScript.

- 👩‍🎓 I will finish a 8 month immersive web development course with CareerFoundry by September 2022.
- 💡 I’m currently considering doing a new version of my portfolio page in next.js, tailwind CSS, and the library rough notation.
- 💟 I love doing meticulous work to review, improve design and details and make the code cleaner.
- 👀 I’m always excited to learn new programming languages, expand my understanding of the whole programming ecosystem and keep up with the always-evolving world of programming.
- 🛠️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fantastic projects with a good cause. If it is outside of my current scope, the better. I am willing to study intensely to learn.
