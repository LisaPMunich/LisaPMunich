### Hi there 👋 I am Lisa Pape and a certified full-stack web developer with a focus on JavaScript/TypeScript.

- 👩‍🎓 I will finish a 8 month immersive web development course with CareerFoundry by September 2022.
- 💡 I’m currently considering doing a new version of my portfolio page in next.js, tailwind CSS, and the library rough notation.
- 💟 I love doing meticulous work to review, improve design and details and make the code cleaner.
- 📚 I believe in life-long-learning on and off the job. I’m open and willing to learn new skills, tools & programming languages.
- 📫 How to reach me: [my Portfolio Page](https://lisapmunich.github.io/Portfolio-Website/contact.html)
